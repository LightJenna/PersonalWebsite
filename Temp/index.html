      <h1 class="funh1">Origami Is So Much Fun!</h1>
    
      <p class="funp">I enjoy making origami, so I thought, "Hey, why don't I make a website about it?" Here it is. It features some facts about origami, what to do if you don't have the right paper, and of course one of my favorite projects.</p>
    
      <p class="funp">For me, origami has always been relaxing and fun to make. It could be so for you as well. </p>
      <p class="funp">The project I have included isn't my favorite one, but I always enjoy it and it is fairly simple. My favorite project is harder, so I didn't include instructions for a flexigon.</p>
      
      <h1 class="funh1">Here are some other origami projects:</h1>
